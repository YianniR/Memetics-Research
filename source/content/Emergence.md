> In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, **Emergence** occurs when a complex entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and emerge only when they interact in a wider whole.
>
> Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry and physics.
>
> In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.
