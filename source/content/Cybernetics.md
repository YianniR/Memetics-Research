Cybernetics (to me) is more of a mechanistic view of the memetic communication channels in an organism - leading to terms like "memetic engineering" which i find a bit disturbing sometimes as it tends to lean towards the "eumemics" and not the "promemics" paradigm. I.e. what is the rational inteligent design for this organism (company) instead of the natural evolution and cultivation of its flourishing.

Cybernetics in my view is a subset of memetics that deals with "command" and "government". in greek a cybernitis is the person who governs. so imo, cybernetics points to the coordination problem, the alignment problem, and all the "-cracies" (democracy, aristocracy, plutocracy etc etc etc) in other words (very very vague analogy that i need to refine incoming) if memetics is the electricity and the logic gates, cybernetics is the turing machine
