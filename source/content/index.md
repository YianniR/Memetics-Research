**Welcome to my research vault!**

This open source cooperative digital garden is my attempt to satisfy my curiosity regarding the complex fractal eco-system that we call *[[Life|life]]*. I am attempting to unify the fields of biology, psychology, and sociology by contributing to the refinement of two new linguistic frames/scientific fields: [[Memetics]] and [[cybernetics]].

For more information regarding my long term motivations (besides innate curiosity) checkout my [[research manifesto]] and [[research strategy]], and to find out where I'm taking my research next checkout my [[research direction]] and my [[Map of Content]].

This research is done in partnership with the [Open Research Institute](https://open-research-institute.github.io/)
