title: Memetics Research
---
**Welcome to my Evergreen Memetics Research vault!**

This vault is my attempt to satisfy my curiosity regarding the complex fractal eco-system that we call *[[Life|life]]*. I am attempting to unify the fields of psychology and sociology by contributing to the development of a new linguistic frame: Memetics. Memetics is an attempt to explain complex system patterns in various domains and scales and find a single theory of information evolution. 

For more information regarding my long term motivations (besides innate curiosity) checkout my [[Research Manifesto]] and [[Research Strategy]], and to find out where I'm taking my research next checkout my [[Research Direction]] and my [[Map of Content]].

This research is done in [[Partners|partnership]] with the [Open Research Institute](https://open-research-institute.github.io/)
