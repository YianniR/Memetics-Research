This vault is my attempt to satisfy my curiosity regarding the complex fractal eco-system that we call *life*. I am hoping to contribute to the development of the new linguistic frame of Memetics with the hope that it can be used to explain complex system patterns in various domains and scales. 
Any hypothesis that I reach will also be accompanied by experimental setups to prove/disprove them.
