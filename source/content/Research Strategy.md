I am really aligned with the principles of Agile, so this research is very incremental and iterative. I view this vault as a garden of ideas and curiosities. 

My aim is to perform a systematic review the literature and pin down definitions and develop a shared language we can all use to develop this scientific field. I do this in [[Foundational Memetics]]

Next, I aim to explore the impact of LLMs to the complex system of [[Life|life]], since they are a kind of [[Memetic Processors]]. I aim to do this in [[Memetics Futurism]].
